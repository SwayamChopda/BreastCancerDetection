🩺 Breast Cancer Detection Android App

This is an Android app that uses a pre-trained machine learning model to detect whether a breast tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on clinical input features. The model is integrated using **TensorFlow Lite** and runs entirely offline on the user’s device.

---

## 📱 Features

- Simple and modern user interface
- Built using Android Studio and Java
- Powered by TensorFlow Lite for on-device ML
- Fast and offline predictions
- Easy input of clinical features
- Accurate binary classification (benign/malignant)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

This app uses a `.tflite` model trained on a breast cancer dataset (likely the **Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset**). The model processes features such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, and more to predict the class of the tumor.
